# Error handling guidelines

- This application is run in a browser. The end user and the LLM/Assistant can see information displayed in the streamlit by way of the message manager. They cannot see console messages from print() statements.
- So, print statements should only be used for unrecoverable errors where neither the user or the asssitent can take corrective action 
- If corrective action is possible, the wording of the messages from the message manager should suggest a course of action. E.g. "there is not dataframe, do a SELECT..."
