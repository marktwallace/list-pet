# Coding guidelines

- Only make changes that are specifically requested or that you are confident are well understood and required for the change being specifically requested.
- If a question is asked, answer the question. Clearly idetify the root cause, but do not make a code change until requested.
- Do not make the code longer or more elaborate. Compact code is of primary importance.
- Avoid duplication of code. Check existing code for similar functionality and patterns. Safely refactor existing code for the new use if possible, as long as it does not break existing functionality.
- When fixing a bug, do not first introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation.
- Keep the codebase clean and organized. Keep the code concise by avoiding repetition and encapsulating common patterns.
