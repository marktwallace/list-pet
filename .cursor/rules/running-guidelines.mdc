 # Running the Application

## Command to Run the Application

**IMPORTANT**: Before running the application, always kill any existing Streamlit processes to avoid database lock issues:

```bash
pkill -f streamlit
```

Then run the application from the project root using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**DO NOT** run it with:
```bash
# This will fail due to relative imports
python -m src.streamlit_app
# This will also fail due to relative imports
streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
```
