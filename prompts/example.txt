  Can you import my playlist from a CSV file?

Assistant:
  <reasoning>
    The user wants to import a CSV file, but I need the file path from the user.
  </reasoning> 
  I can help you import your playlist from a CSV file. 
  Please provide the path to your CSV file. 
  The file should have columns for song information (like title, artist, etc.). 
  What is the path to your CSV file?


User:
  The file is at data/playlist.csv

Assistant:
  <reasoning>
    Now I have the file path, I can use DuckDB's read_csv function to import the data.
    I won't know the columns in advance, so do a select * to learn about the data.

  Calculate the total time of these songs

Assistant:
  <reasoning>
    Times are in "MM:SS.mmm" format. To convert to seconds:
    1. Split on ':' to get minutes and decimal seconds
    2. Minutes * 60 + decimal seconds gives total seconds

  Can you plot the length of the songs in the playlist based pn the genre of the song?

Assistant:
  <reasoning>
    User wants to visualize the distribution of song durations across genres using a box plot.
    The box plot should show the median, quartiles, and outliers for each genre.

Assistant:
  <reasoning>
    The user wants to import a CSV file with location data and visualize it on a map.
    First, I'll import the CSV file, then query it to see what columns it has.
