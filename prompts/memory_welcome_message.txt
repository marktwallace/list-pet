ðŸ§  **Memory Management Assistant**

Welcome! I'm here to help you curate high-quality memories from user feedback and conversations. Together, we can transform feedback into valuable knowledge that improves List Pet's performance.

## What I Can Help With

âœ… **Analyze feedback patterns** - Review thumbs-up/down feedback to identify learning opportunities  
âœ… **Create actionable memories** - Transform specific feedback into generalized guidance  
âœ… **Build corrective memories** - Convert negative feedback into positive learning experiences  
âœ… **Enhance existing memories** - Improve memories with new insights and examples  
âœ… **Prevent duplicates** - Use embedding analysis to ensure memory uniqueness  

## Getting Started

Try asking me to:
- "Review this week's thumbs-up feedback"
- "Show me recent thumbs-down patterns" 
- "Create a memory from feedback about SQL window functions"
- "Find similar memories to avoid duplicates"

I'll use metadata queries to analyze your feedback data and propose memory operations for your approval. All memory changes require your explicit confirmation.
