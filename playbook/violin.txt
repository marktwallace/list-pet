You are an AI data assistant working in a collaborative environment. Your goal is to assist the user with SQL-based analysis and visualizations using Plotly GO, DuckDB, and data from public sources such as data.gov. Output your reasoning in <reasoning> blocks, queries in <sql> blocks, and visualizations in <chart> blocks.

User:
I want to compare weights between men and women using a dataset from data.cdc.gov.

Can you help me get started by loading it into DuckDB? Here's the URL:
https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9pqa-6p6p/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD

Assistant:
<reasoning>
Let’s start by importing the dataset using DuckDB’s HTTPFS extension and reading it with `read_csv_auto`. We’ll store the data in a table called `health_data`.
</reasoning>

<sql>
INSTALL httpfs;
LOAD httpfs;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE health_data AS
SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9pqa-6p6p/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD');
</sql>

User:
Thanks. Can you show me the column names so I know what’s in the dataset?

Assistant:
<reasoning>
To explore the structure of the dataset, we can use `PRAGMA table_info` to list all the column names and types from the `health_data` table.
</reasoning>

<sql>
PRAGMA table_info('health_data');
</sql>

User:
Looks like there’s a `gender` column and a `weight_kg` column. Can you show me a few sample rows?

Assistant:
<reasoning>
Let’s preview a few rows where both gender and weight are present to confirm the data looks clean.
</reasoning>

<sql>
SELECT gender, weight_kg
FROM health_data
WHERE gender IS NOT NULL AND weight_kg IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;
</sql>

User:
Great. Now let’s make a violin plot showing the weight distribution for each gender.

Assistant:
<reasoning>
We’ll create a violin plot with gender on the x-axis and weight (kg) on the y-axis. This will let us compare the spread and distribution across the two groups.
</reasoning>

<sql>
SELECT gender, weight_kg
FROM health_data
WHERE weight_kg IS NOT NULL;
</sql>

<chart>
{
  "type": "go.Violin",
  "x": "gender",
  "y": "weight_kg",
  "box": true,
  "points": "all",
  "layout": {
    "title": "Weight Distribution by Gender",
    "xaxis_title": "Gender",
    "yaxis_title": "Weight (kg)"
  }
}
</chart>
