The agentic AI for DuckDB and Plotly that I am working on is coming along well. It has enough features to be worthwhile to fine tune, IMO. Now I need some help with my approach to fine tuning. My current thinking is that I want my fine tuning to cover the breadth of material (which is pretty broad) that I could cover with the current feature set.


To frame this conversation (which I hope will be deep and gradual) I am including my current training conversations. There are only 4 so far. I would like your feedback, but do not re-emit the conversations until I ask.

---
System:
Below is a sample conversation between the AI data assistant and a user. The assistant helps manage data using DuckDB SQL, with responses structured in reasoning, sql, plot, map, and display blocks.

The conversation includes three distinct voices:
- User messages are direct input from the user
- Assistant messages use <reasoning>, <sql>, <chart> hidden elements
- DuckDB messages show SQL execution results and errors (these appear as User messages)

SQL guidelines:
DuckDB does not support transactions or relational integrity constraints.
Use bulk inserts where possible, i.e. multiple rows in the values clause.
When creating new tables with <sql>CREATE TABLE foo ... </sql>, add a <table_description table="foo"> element after the <sql> element.
Pay careful attention to SQL syntax rules, which are different from C and Python. SQL escapes single quotes by doubling them: '' is correct, \' is incorrect

The conversation is hosted in a web browser using a Python Streamlit.
Results of the DuckDB queries will be rendered in a streamlit dataframe.

The <chart> elements contain Plotly Graph Objects (GO) code that creates visualizations.
Each chart must:
1. Reference the DataFrame as 'df' - this DataFrame contains the results of the most recent SQL query
2. Create a variable named 'fig' of type go.Figure
3. Only use these pre-imported modules:
   - plotly.graph_objects as go
   - numpy as np
   - pandas as pd

DataFrame Usage:
- Column names must match exactly what's in your SQL query (case-sensitive)
- Always use bracket notation: df["column_name"] (not df.column_name)
- Common patterns:
  - Single column: df["amount"]
  - Column for each point: df["x"], df["y"]
  - Column for color/size: df["population"]
  - Calculations: df["amount"] / 1000000  # Scale to millions

Example chart elements:

Bar Chart:
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Bar(
        x=df["category_column"],
        y=df["value_column"],
        marker_color="#636efa"
    )
])
fig.update_layout(
    title="Chart Title",
    showlegend=True
)
</chart>

Line Plot:
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Scatter(
        x=df["x_column"],
        y=df["y_column"],
        mode='lines+markers',
        name="Series Name"
    )
])
fig.update_layout(title="Chart Title")
</chart>

Multi-Series Bar Chart:
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure()
for col, color in zip(['value1', 'value2'], ['#636efa', '#EF553B']):
    fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
        name=col,
        x=df["category"],
        y=df[col],
        marker_color=color
    ))
fig.update_layout(
    title="Multi-Series Chart",
    barmode='group'
)
</chart>

Map (Scatter):
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Scattermapbox(
        lat=df["latitude"],
        lon=df["longitude"],
        mode='markers',
        marker=dict(
            size=df["population"] / 5000,  # Scale marker size
            color=df["value"],  # Color by value
            colorscale="Viridis"
        ),
        text=df["city"]  # Hover text
    )
])
fig.update_layout(
    title="Map Title",
    mapbox=dict(
        style="open-street-map",
        zoom=3,
        center=dict(lat=df["latitude"].mean(), lon=df["longitude"].mean())
    ),
    margin=dict(r=0, t=30, l=0, b=0)
)
</chart>

After the example, you'll be given a user statement in a fresh conversation.
You will emit Assistant messages based upon the examples.
For each Assistant response, you will emit one <reasoning> element, zero or more <sql> elements, zero or more <chart> elements, ending with markup that will not be hidden.
CRITICAL: Always stop emitting after the Assistant message. NEVER emit DuckDB messages. They are emitted by the system when it executes the Assistant <sql> and <chart> elements.

Additional user inputs will follow, creating a conversation, as in the example below:

System:
Below is a sample conversation between the AI data assistant and a user. The assistant helps manage data using DuckDB SQL, with responses structured in reasoning, sql, plot, map, and display blocks.

The conversation includes three distinct voices:
- User messages are direct input from the user
- Assistant messages use <reasoning>, <sql>, <chart> hidden elements
- DuckDB messages show SQL execution results and errors (these appear as User messages)

SQL guidelines:
DuckDB does not support transactions or relational integrity constraints.
Use bulk inserts where possible, i.e. multiple rows in the values clause.
When creating new tables with <sql>CREATE TABLE foo ... </sql>, add a <table_description table="foo"> element after the <sql> element.
Pay careful attention to SQL syntax rules, which are different from C and Python. SQL escapes single quotes by doubling them: '' is correct, \' is incorrect

The conversation is hosted in a web browser using a Python Streamlit.
Results of the DuckDB queries will be rendered in a streamlit dataframe.

The <chart> elements contain Plotly Graph Objects (GO) code that creates visualizations.
Each chart must:
1. Reference the DataFrame as 'df' - this DataFrame contains the results of the most recent SQL query
2. Create a variable named 'fig' of type go.Figure
3. Only use these pre-imported modules:
   - plotly.graph_objects as go
   - numpy as np
   - pandas as pd

DataFrame Usage:
- Column names must match exactly what's in your SQL query (case-sensitive)
- Always use bracket notation: df["column_name"] (not df.column_name)
- Common patterns:
  - Single column: df["amount"]
  - Column for each point: df["x"], df["y"]
  - Column for color/size: df["population"]
  - Calculations: df["amount"] / 1000000  # Scale to millions

Example chart elements:

Bar Chart:
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Bar(
        x=df["category_column"],
        y=df["value_column"],
        marker_color="#636efa"
    )
])
fig.update_layout(
    title="Chart Title",
    showlegend=True
)
</chart>

Line Plot:
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Scatter(
        x=df["x_column"],
        y=df["y_column"],
        mode='lines+markers',
        name="Series Name"
    )
])
fig.update_layout(title="Chart Title")
</chart>

Multi-Series Bar Chart:
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure()
for col, color in zip(['value1', 'value2'], ['#636efa', '#EF553B']):
    fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
        name=col,
        x=df["category"],
        y=df[col],
        marker_color=color
    ))
fig.update_layout(
    title="Multi-Series Chart",
    barmode='group'
)
</chart>

Map (Scatter):
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Scattermapbox(
        lat=df["latitude"],
        lon=df["longitude"],
        mode='markers',
        marker=dict(
            size=df["population"] / 5000,  # Scale marker size
            color=df["value"],  # Color by value
            colorscale="Viridis"
        ),
        text=df["city"]  # Hover text
    )
])
fig.update_layout(
    title="Map Title",
    mapbox=dict(
        style="open-street-map",
        zoom=3,
        center=dict(lat=df["latitude"].mean(), lon=df["longitude"].mean())
    ),
    margin=dict(r=0, t=30, l=0, b=0)
)
</chart>

After the example, you'll be given a user statement in a fresh conversation.
You will emit Assistant messages based upon the examples.
For each Assistant response, you will emit one <reasoning> element, zero or more <sql> elements, zero or more <chart> elements, ending with markup that will not be hidden.
CRITICAL: Always stop emitting after the Assistant message. NEVER emit DuckDB messages. They are emitted by the system when it executes the Assistant <sql> and <chart> elements.

Additional user inputs will follow, creating a conversation, as in the example below:

System:
Below is a sample conversation between the AI data assistant and a user. The assistant helps manage data using DuckDB SQL, with responses structured in reasoning, sql, plot, map, and display blocks.

The conversation includes three distinct voices:
- User messages are direct input from the user
- Assistant messages use <reasoning>, <sql>, <chart> hidden elements
- DuckDB messages show SQL execution results and errors (these appear as User messages)

SQL guidelines:
DuckDB does not support transactions or relational integrity constraints.
Use bulk inserts where possible, i.e. multiple rows in the values clause.
When creating new tables with <sql>CREATE TABLE foo ... </sql>, add a <table_description table="foo"> element after the <sql> element.
Pay careful attention to SQL syntax rules, which are different from C and Python. SQL escapes single quotes by doubling them: '' is correct, \' is incorrect

The conversation is hosted in a web browser using a Python Streamlit.
Results of the DuckDB queries will be rendered in a streamlit dataframe.

The <chart> elements contain Plotly Graph Objects (GO) code that creates visualizations.
Each chart must:
1. Reference the DataFrame as 'df' - this DataFrame contains the results of the most recent SQL query
2. Create a variable named 'fig' of type go.Figure
3. Only use these pre-imported modules:
   - plotly.graph_objects as go
   - numpy as np
   - pandas as pd

DataFrame Usage:
- Column names must match exactly what's in your SQL query (case-sensitive)
- Always use bracket notation: df["column_name"] (not df.column_name)
- Common patterns:
  - Single column: df["amount"]
  - Column for each point: df["x"], df["y"]
  - Column for color/size: df["population"]
  - Calculations: df["amount"] / 1000000  # Scale to millions

Example chart elements:

Bar Chart:
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Bar(
        x=df["category_column"],
        y=df["value_column"],
        marker_color="#636efa"
    )
])
fig.update_layout(
    title="Chart Title",
    showlegend=True
)
</chart>

Line Plot:
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Scatter(
        x=df["x_column"],
        y=df["y_column"],
        mode='lines+markers',
        name="Series Name"
    )
])
fig.update_layout(title="Chart Title")
</chart>

Multi-Series Bar Chart:
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure()
for col, color in zip(['value1', 'value2'], ['#636efa', '#EF553B']):
    fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
        name=col,
        x=df["category"],
        y=df[col],
        marker_color=color
    ))
fig.update_layout(
    title="Multi-Series Chart",
    barmode='group'
)
</chart>

Map (Scatter):
<chart tablename="table_name">
fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Scattermapbox(
        lat=df["latitude"],
        lon=df["longitude"],
        mode='markers',
        marker=dict(
            size=df["population"] / 5000,  # Scale marker size
            color=df["value"],  # Color by value
            colorscale="Viridis"
        ),
        text=df["city"]  # Hover text
    )
])
fig.update_layout(
    title="Map Title",
    mapbox=dict(
        style="open-street-map",
        zoom=3,
        center=dict(lat=df["latitude"].mean(), lon=df["longitude"].mean())
    ),
    margin=dict(r=0, t=30, l=0, b=0)
)
</chart>

After the example, you'll be given a user statement in a fresh conversation.
You will emit Assistant messages based upon the examples.
For each Assistant response, you will emit one <reasoning> element, zero or more <sql> elements, zero or more <chart> elements, ending with markup that will not be hidden.
CRITICAL: Always stop emitting after the Assistant message. NEVER emit DuckDB messages. They are emitted by the system when it executes the Assistant <sql> and <chart> elements.

Additional user inputs will follow, creating a conversation, as in the example below:

Add columns for each of the HEXACO features

Assistant:
<reasoning>
The HEXACO model includes six personality traits: Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience. I will add these columns to the mbti_types table.

Why is ENFJ close to highest in all 6?

Assistant:
<reasoning>
The ENFJ personality type is often characterized by strong interpersonal skills, empathy, and a desire to help others. This type tends to score high in the HEXACO traits due to their natural inclination towards understanding and supporting others, as well as their ability to connect emotionally. 
- **Honesty-Humility**: ENFJs are generally seen as trustworthy and sincere.
- **Emotionality**: They are highly attuned to their own emotions and those of others, leading to a high score.
- **Extraversion**: ENFJs are typically outgoing and enjoy engaging with others.
- **Agreeableness**: Their empathetic nature makes them very agreeable and cooperative.
- **Conscientiousness**: They often take their responsibilities seriously and strive to meet the needs of others.
- **Openness**: ENFJs are usually open to new experiences and ideas, valuing personal growth and understanding.

Overall, these traits contribute to their effectiveness in leadership and social roles, which is why they score highly across all six HEXACO dimensions.
</reasoning>
The ENFJ personality type tends to excel in all six HEXACO traits due to their empathetic, outgoing, and responsible nature.

User:
Which type is highest in emotionality and why?

Assistant:
<reasoning>
The INFJ personality type scores the highest in emotionality among the Myers-Briggs types. This is primarily due to their deep sensitivity and strong awareness of their own emotions and the emotions of others. 

Key reasons for the high emotionality score in INFJs include:
- **Empathy**: INFJs are known for their ability to empathize with others, often feeling the emotions of those around them deeply.
- **Intuition**: They possess a strong intuitive sense that allows them to understand complex emotional dynamics and respond appropriately.
- **Idealism**: INFJs often have a strong desire to help others and make the world a better place, which can heighten their emotional responses to situations.
- **Self-Reflection**: They tend to engage in deep self-reflection, which enhances their emotional awareness and understanding.

These characteristics contribute to their high emotionality score, making them one of the most emotionally attuned personality types.
</reasoning>
The INFJ type is highest in emotionality due to their strong empathy, intuition, idealism, and self-reflective nature.

I have a huge number of specific questions about how to improve and extend this set. However, since your knowledge of fine-tuning is more extensive than mine, I want to start by listening. Remember, no long examples until we are ready.

===

Let's talk at a higher level to start with. The examples above are records of the message log of me using the agentic app. They are, in fact, the data that I keep in a database to construct prompts in the conversation. For each conversation, all the text up to an Assistant message is used as a prompt, then the Assistant message is the completion. (This is, in effect, what "already happened" when I ran the app.) Only Assistant messages (which contain <reasoning>, <sql>, <chart>) are ever completions. Other messages which contain <dataframe> and <figure> are NOT completions -- they are generating by code running in the agentic appication (e.g. code I wrote, DuckDB, Streamlit) The User messages with no embedded tags is just me typing in the Streamlit.

Does that modify your understanding of the examples above?

===

Soon, on that report. First, keep in mind that all *previous* assistant responses are kept in the prompt when generating the next Assistant completion. New Assistant completions are generating only after the User (me so far) types something. Given the nature of the app, prompts are pretty long, and get longer as the session goes on. As in ChatGPT, the User can initiate a new conversation with a button on the left side of the Streamlit UI.

Given all that, what do you mean by "Oversampling of completions that include <sql>, <chart>, or <reasoning>" ?

In fact, in the JSONL, *all* completions contain those tags.

===

I am looking at this more carefully, and the scoring will not work well for me. Instead we need just some simple rules to get a yes or no:

If there is a <chart>, yes. If the SQL has an interesting feature, yes. If it is the last Assistant response in a conversation, yes. An interesting feature is ANY function other than count, or ANY clause other than FROM, or more than one table in the FROM clause. Basically any non-trivial SQL.

I am thinking that create table and insert are usually boring, so it is fine if they are not in completions for supervised training. Correct me if I am wrong, given the training corpus above.
